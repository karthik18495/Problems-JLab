# Problem 2

The problem that was given is as follows

> The goal of this exercise is to create a generative adversarial network to reproduce the tabular data found [eICU_age.npy](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/jlab_datascience_data/blob/main/eICU_age.npy). The dataset includes the ages of critical care patients seen across intensive care units in the United States. The original data is from the eICU Collaborative Research Database [eicu](https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/about/eicu/).
To solve this problem implement a generative adversarial network (GAN) in python to produce the distri- bution of age for these patients. Your script must coordinate both the generator and discriminator models. Please provide figures to illustrate this coordination and compare the distribution from the generator model output with that of the true distribution.

## Data

The data corresponds to distribution of ICU Patients through out USA within a fixed age group. The data in "unbinned". 

Strategy is to treat the Data as a 1D Vector Sequence of length corresponding to the age range of the data. This way, 

## Organization of the scripts

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The data is quite straight forward. 

## Data Preprocessing and normalization

## Types of GAN that was explored

### Simple-GAN

### Deep Convolutional GAN

### Conditional GAN

## Hyper-parameter optimization efforts
