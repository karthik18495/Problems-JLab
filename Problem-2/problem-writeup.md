# Problem 2

The problem deals with 1-D GAN

## Data

The data corresponds to distribution of ICU Patients through out USA within a fixed age group. The data in "unbinned". 

Strategy is to treat the Data as a 1D Vector Sequence of length corresponding to the age range of the data. This way, 

## Organization of the scripts

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The data is quite straight forward. 

## Data Preprocessing and normalization

## Types of GAN that was explored

### Simple-GAN

### Deep Convolutional GAN

### Conditional GAN

## Hyper-parameter optimization efforts
